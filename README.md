- CRD: Coverage Requirements Discovery

ePriorAuth (Electronic Prior Authorization) 1.0 consists of: CRD 1.0.0, DTR 1.1.0, and PAS 1.1.0.

The ePriorAuth subfolder is for sample merge.cpf files that combine the individual components' merge files, to provide an example of a merge file that should work for setting up all three together. The config.json files for each component module cannot be combined in this way as of ePA 1.0.
